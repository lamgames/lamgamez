The only bandwidth we need to pay is when our server calls their Platform API to ""manage"" the chat (e.g., creating users, issuing session token), which I guess won't transfer that much data.If I remember correctly, AWS egress fees could be pretty hefty, given that they count the rate on per GB data? Considering that we are talking about video streaming here, it would definitely incur a significant cost. Hence, to make a fairer comparison (esp. in percentage of cost reduction), could you help to provide some approximation on data rate cost that we may need to pay?Note that this probably won't still be that fair and need some special notes on engineering cost to maintain the infra.

Also, it is pretty dangerous to experiment in this environment since we don't want to lose/tamper existing data.stgMain purpose: mimic the production setup on a best-effort basis.Ideally, before executing anything that is relatively risky toward the prod data (e.g., SQL migration), it should be tested on this environment first.As per the latest discussion, this environment would probably be available on-demand in the cloud (in case one needs to test with data which may not be available/feasible to use in local).We could also have a local version of this environment, which contains various historical data that might be useful to test for backward compatibility.Example: we currently store the historical SQL scripts that have been executed in production.In general, when writing a new database migration script, one should write it into the SQL directory for this environment, which could be ""simulated"" in local as Docker entrypoint to test whether it has any bugs or could cause an undesired behavior.devMain purpose: support an agile development.The setup should be flexible enough to keep being updated as we add new features and have a quite robust seed data.This environment is also expected to store minimum overhead of historical data. Perhaps only the relatively recent ones to check for backward compatibility, since otherwise the production environment would probably have finished the migration and created a new snapshot.A more robust backward compatibility testing should be performed on the staging environment.Some default setup for this environment (e.g., database schemas, default configs) should be auto-generated based on the historical staging data for consistency using available scripts. However, the rest of the seed data (e.g., existing users, spaces, posts) should be freely modified for the convenience of local development.testMain purpose: execute unit/integration/stress/etc. tests.The environment should be relatively clean with minimum setup needed to run our various test cases.In case some tests need extra seed data being populated, they should create their own up/down migrations in a separate directory. Those migrations could then be run when the test suite starts/ends.With this, we won't have a situation where one test interferes with the data for other tests.One warning is not to enable parallel execution for the test cases since interleaving up/down migrations could cause an undesired behavior.Similar with the dev env, some default setup such as database schemas and default configs should be auto-generated based on the historical staging data for consistency using available scripts.","Looks good to me!
